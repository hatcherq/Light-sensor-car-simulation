# Robot-sensor-car-simulation
This is an simulation of servo motor light sensor(RI) Shield-bot with Automatic distance indication;
The Shield-bot used infra-red (IR) as an input to control the servo motors, it has infra-red (IR) LED as a "headlight" 
and pair it with an IR receiver to detect the light being reflected off walls and objects. 
Similar to the visible light sensor, as a wall moves closer, the IR receiver will detect more reflected IR light.
