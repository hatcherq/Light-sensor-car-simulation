# Robot-sensor-car-simulation
This is an software simulations of servo motor light sensor(RI) Shield-bot with Automatic distance indication;

The Shield-bot used infra-red (IR) as an input to control the servo motors, it has infra-red (IR) LED as a "headlight" 
and pair it with an IR receiver to detect the light being reflected off walls and objects. 
Similar to the visible light sensor, as a wall moves closer, the IR receiver will detect more reflected IR light.
In this software simulation, the shield-bot equiped with front, left and right sensors, there are maze wall which meant for shield-bot to navigate. 

Press enter to run sheild bot automatically or use the arrow sign on the keyboard ← → to turn left and right ↑ to move forward/increase speed ↓ to decrease speed.

New mazes are available under walls.md, thinner gaps between walls, wider walls, curved walls
